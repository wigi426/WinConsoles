# WinConsoles Working notes

-   Define interface fully first
-   use one form of error handling, probably exceptions in places where they are absolutely needed
-   otherwise best to have a publicly accessibly validity flag. which is set when the user attempts to use the interface incorreclty
-   ideally however the interface should be hard to use wrong.
