considerations:

    1) cannot compile logger on runtime, unless you construct a cmake file then run then run the cmake the run the cmake build
        ^^^ i think thats the best option tbh, use 'lazy' compilation at runtime using a cmake file written as a literal into code
    3) build with CMAKE for cross compatability
